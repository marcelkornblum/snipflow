> A workflow for productive engineers and their teams

Snipflow is a workflow based on GitHub Flow but with some additions, and covering more than just git. For most teams, no new tooling or purchases are required to use it.

SnipFlow connects version control, issue tracking, CI and non-production environments into a cohesive way of working. It reduces admin and context switching, improves communication and transparency between team members, and scales from side hustles to business critical product teams.

Browse the repo, [read the docs](./docs/readme.md), or [browse the website](https://snipflow.works) built from the docs.
