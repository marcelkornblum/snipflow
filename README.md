# SnipFlow Methodology

> A workflow for productive engineers

SnipFlow is a workflow for developers which connects version control, issue tracking, CI and non-production environments into a cohesive way of working. It reduces admin and context switching, improves communication and transparency between team members, and scales from side hustles to business critical product teams.
