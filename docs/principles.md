> The main guiding principles behind SnipFlow

Your time is valuable

The most valuable things you do need long unbroken stretches of time

Repetitive tasks should be automated

Historical context about code you've written increase in importance as your project progresses

All configuration and non-secret settings should be versioned

Fewer tools and simpler integrations mean less maintenance and higher productivity

Complex methodologies lead to shortcuts, or individuals responsible for maintaining them, or at least extra documentation, and longer onboarding

Your colleagues need to be able to check on progress, and their timetables are different to yours

A central CI environment should be the “source of truth” to eliminate “it works on my machine” type issues
