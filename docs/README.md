# The SnipFlow methodology

SnipFlow connects version control, issue tracking, CI and non-production environments into a cohesive way of working.

It reduces admin and developer context switching, improves communication and transparency between all team members, and scales from side hustles to business critical product teams.

Whatever your current toolset, SnipFlow uses automation and a shared terminology to connect the dots between technical tools - like version control and CI tooling - with project management and communication tools - like issue trackers, team chat and preview environments.

Tested by many teams over several years, the SnipFlow workflow results in improved developer focus and fewer administrative tasks, along with better transparency for leads and managers, and easier rationalising during complex debugging.

## Why use SnipFlow?

SnipFlow costs nothing, is easy to understand and onboard teams to, and doesn't replace any of your existing tooling.

It gives your team a simple way to connect everything together, easy ways to deploy and places to review your work in various stages, as well as standard terminology, so that communication becomes easier and everyday tasks become simpler and less risky.

There are many tools to help manage aspects of coders' work, but many of them end up needing technical administration, often without warning, which breaks a developer's flow state. SnipFlow abstracts these tasks to automation systems and ChatOps, removing the onus on the individual developer.

Most out-of-the-box automation-based tooling is aimed at single developers and small projects; as these projects grow and the team realises that it could be improved, often the switching cost is already too high. Alternatively developers need to work in different ways depending on whether they're in the day job on a team that prioritises code integrity, or the weekend project where simple processes are the priority. SnipFlow provides a scalable workflow that suits both of these priorities, meaning less cognitive load for developers across various work, fewer process errors, and quicker onboarding for new team members.

The majority of the "just works" tooling available doesn't connect very well to an overall project workflow; for example systems like Git Flow don't connect happily to tools that allow you to "push to a specific branch to deploy to a specific environment". SnipFlow replaces the OOTB automations with custom CI scripts that are simple to understand and extend, but that support the wider workflow 100%.

Teams that use SnipFlow encounter drastically fewer situations where they are asked to do boring - and often risky - tasks when they could be productive.
